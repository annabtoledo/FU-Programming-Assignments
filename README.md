## Assignment 2
The EEG data are a 3D tensor:
200 Image conditions × 63 EEG channels × 140 Time points (s)
1. Download eeg_data_assignment_2.mat from Blackboard, and load its contents in your workspace.
2. What is the mean EEG voltage at 0.1 seconds for occipital channels (i.e., channels whose name contains the
letter “O”)? And for frontal channels (i.e., channels whose name contains the letter “F”)?
3. On the same plot, visualize the timecourse of the mean EEG voltage across all image conditions and EEG
channels, averaged across the 200 image conditions.
a. For this, use Matlab’s figure, hold on, and plot functions.
b. The time dimension should be on the x-axis, and the EEG voltage on the y-axis.
What are the similarities and differences between timecourses of the different channels? What do you
think is the reason for these similarities and differences?
4. On the same plot, visualize the timecourse of the (i) mean EEG voltage across all image conditions and
occipital channels, as well as of the (ii) mean EEG voltage across all image conditions and frontal channels.
What are the similarities and differences between the two timecourses? What do you think is the reason for
these similarities and differences?
5. On the same plot, visualize the timecourse of the (i) mean EEG voltage across all occipital channels for the
first image condition, as well as of the (ii) mean EEG voltage across all occipital channels for the second
image condition. What are the similarities and differences between the two curves? What do you think is
the reason for these similarities and differences?
